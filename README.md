#Background 
Despite reduction in infant mortality rate, SIDS remains a source of concern in Zambia. Yet the prevalence of risk and protective factors for SIDS are poorly understood due to limited research and inadequate funding. The aim of our study was to strengthen previous findings about the prevalence of SIDS risk factors by corroborating data from both a prospective cohort, with a sleep survey asked at one timepoint.

#Method
Data from both a prospective birth cohort and cross-sectional study were combined to answer the question about the prevalence of risk and protective factors of SIDS in a disadvantaged community in Lusaka, Zambia. A structured questionnaire, asked at the 20-week study visit, was used to obtain data about the sleeping and environmental risks associated with SIDS.
