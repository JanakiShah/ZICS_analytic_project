## Background 
Despite reduction in infant mortality rate, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains a source of concern in Zambia. Yet the prevalence of risk and protective factors for SIDS are poorly understood due to limited research and inadequate funding. The aim of our study was to strengthen previous findings about the prevalence of SIDS risk factors by corroborating data from both a prospective cohort, with a sleep survey asked at one timepoint.

### Method
Data from both a prospective birth cohort and cross-sectional study were combined to answer the question about the prevalence of risk and protective factors of SIDS in a disadvantaged community in Lusaka, Zambia. A structured questionnaire, asked at the 20-week study visit, was used to obtain data about the sleeping and environmental risks associated with SIDS. 

#### Results
By the end of the survey period, data had been collected from 596 caregivers and 605 infants. Nearly three quarters of caregivers did not attain an education beyond secondary school and a significant proportion of infants (20.2%) had low birth weight. While 90.2% of mothers reported some form of breastfeeding by six months, a huge percentage of mothers (98.2%) reported sharing a sleep surface with their infants.

##### Conclusion
The results of this study show that both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors of SIDS are highly prevalent in low socio-economic settings in Zambia. Public health strategies to prevent SIDS will need to be innovative in how to address risks such as bedsharing in settings where there is lack of space. Additionally, future public health communication will need to be clearer in areas which attract contrasting views such as low birth weight and breastfeeding in SIDS.
