## Background 
Despite reduction in infant mortality rate, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains a source of concern in Zambia. Yet the prevalence of risk and protective factors for SIDS are poorly understood due to limited research and inadequate funding. The aim of our study was to strengthen previous findings about the prevalence of SIDS risk factors by corroborating data from both a prospective cohort, with a sleep survey asked at one timepoint.

## Method
Data from both a prospective birth cohort and cross-sectional study were combined to answer the question about the prevalence of risk and protective factors of SIDS in a disadvantaged community in Lusaka, Zambia. A structured questionnaire, asked at the 20-week study visit, was used to obtain data about the sleeping and environmental risks associated with SIDS. 

## Results
By the end of the survey period, data had been collected from 596 caregivers and 605 infants. Nearly three quarters of caregivers did not attain an education beyond secondary school and a significant proportion of infants (20.2%) had low birth weight. While 90.2% of mothers reported some form of breastfeeding by six months, a huge percentage of mothers (98.2%) reported sharing a sleep surface with their infants.

## Conclusion
The results of this study show that both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors of SIDS are highly prevalent in low socio-economic settings in Zambia. Public health strategies to prevent SIDS will need to be innovative in how to address risks such as bedsharing in settings where there is lack of space. Additionally, future public health communication will need to be clearer in areas which attract contrasting views such as low birth weight and breastfeeding in SIDS.

## Discussion
The results of this study, the first to triangulate SIDS risk factors from both a birth cohort and a cross-sectional study in Zambia, strengthens the findings that both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors of SIDS are exceptionally prevalent in low socioeconomic settings.

#### Maternal Education
A significant number of mothers in our study did not attain an education level beyond secondary school. This finding was also reported by Osei-poku et al. (2022). Since most SIDS prevention campaigns are focused on parental education and behavioural modification of infant care, an association between SIDS prevalence and maternal education or health literacy is quite likely (8).

#### Alcohol and smoking
It is now well established from a variety of studies that maternal alcohol consumption and smoking increases the risk of SIDS (9). While we found low consumption of alcohol and smoking in our cohort of mothers, we cannot conclude about the prevalence of maternal smoking and alcohol consumption among SIDS mothers due to the paucity of prospectively obtained SIDS incidences. 

#### Prematurity and low birth weight
Prematurity and low birth weight are well known risk factors for SIDS. It has been suggested that the immature autonomic system leaves these infants vulnerable to increased cases of SIDS. In our study, a substantial percentage of infants (20.2%) had low birth weight. This is over twice the percentage of low birth weight recorded in Lusaka in the 2022 annual statistical report (10).  This difference can be explained in part by the higher proportion of HIV infected mothers in our study sample (data not shown here) who happen to be at increased risk of delivering a low birth weight or a premature baby.

#### Breastfeeding and co-sleeping
Our cohort had high uptake of breastfeeding. At 6 months, 43.1% reported exclusive breastfeeding and 90.2% reported some type of breastfeeding. The extensive health benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and infants have been widely reported (11). While breastfeeding is protective against SIDS, it also promotes shared sleeping as evidenced by the high percentage of mothers (98.2%) who reported co-sleeping. Most researchers of SIDS agree on the increased risk of SIDS associated with co-sleeping coupled with prematurity and low birthweight (12). Others disagree. For example, proponents of co-sleeping argue that skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo care) especially among preterm and newborn infants has empirical benefits. They contend that shared sleeping promotes thermoregulation, maternal-infant bonding and longer duration of breastfeeding (13). This contradiction makes it difficult for health professionals to offer best possible advice to mothers.

#### Room sharing
Room sharing without bedsharing is a recognised practice that reduces SIDS significantly. Contrary, only a very small proportion of mothers reported room sharing in our survey. Though we found a much smaller proportion than Osei-poku’s earlier survey (1.5% vs 24.7%), our findings still support previous observations that show that there is low prevalence of room sharing without bed sharing in these disadvantaged communities. Several factors could explain this observation. Firstly, most of these families cannot afford their baby’s bed or larger house due to their socioeconomic circumstances. Secondly, the culture of breastfeeding could be reinforcing bedsharing practice instead of room sharing. 

#### Infant sleeping position
Our results on infant sleeping position seem to be consistent with other research which found high prevalence of lateral and prone position. These two positions are reported to carry the highest risk of SIDS among infants. Many mothers however do believe the prone and lateral position prevent infants from accidentally aspirating their vomitus during sleep (6).

#### Infant bundling/wrapping
Although little is known about how much clothing is required to maintain the infant’s thermal comfort, investigators generally agree that hyperthermia from over bundling should be avoided to reduce the risk of SIDS (14). In our study, nearly three quarters of mothers reported wrapping their babies in two or more layers of clothing. This result agrees with Osei-poku’s (2023) findings which showed that several participants bundled their babies with at least two blankets during sleep.
It is a limitation of our study that we had to rely on self-reported data, especially on risk factors related to infant care practice. However, major strengths of the study include triangulation of data from the prospective cohort. For example, we were able to obtain accurate birth weight and gestation age by taking advantage of the accurate dating by an ultrasound. In addition, we were able to obtain more accurate breastfeeding patterns by administering a questionnaire on several routine visits.
